## Game Overview

### Basic Flow

1. One player (hider) uses public transit to reach a hiding spot during the hiding period
2. Other players (seekers) work together to find them by asking questions
3. Questions are chosen from 6 categories, each with different costs (cards for the hider)
4. Hider must answer truthfully within time limits
5. For each question answered, hider draws cards from their deck
6. Once hider is found, role passes to next player
7. Winner is the player who remained hidden the longest

### Player Requirements

- Minimum: 2 players
- Recommended maximum: 4 players
- Larger groups should form teams that act as a single player

## Question Categories

There are 6 question categories. Each has a specific format, card cost (draw/keep), and response time.

| Category | Format | Draw | Keep | Response Time |
|----------|--------|------|------|---------------|
| **Matching** | "Is your nearest _ the same as my nearest _?" | 3 | 1 | 5 min |
| **Measuring** | "Compared to me, are you closer to or further from _?" | 3 | 1 | 5 min |
| **Radar** | "Are you within _ of me?" | 2 | 1 | 5 min |
| **Thermometer** | "After traveling _, am I hotter or colder?" | 2 | 1 | 5 min |
| **Photo** | "Send us a photo of _" | 1 | 1 | 10 min (S/M), 20 min (L) |
| **Tentacle** | "Within _ of me, which _ are you nearest to? (You must also be within _)" | 4 | 2 | 5 min |

### Card Costs Explained

- **Draw**: How many cards the hider draws from the deck after answering
- **Keep**: How many of those drawn cards the hider keeps (discards the rest)
- Higher-value questions (more info for seekers) = more cards for hider

### Response Time Rules

- Hider must answer within the response time
- Photo questions get extra time due to photo requirements
- Timer starts when seekers submit the question
